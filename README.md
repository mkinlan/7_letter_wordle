## Introduction
This is a simple word-guessing game inspired by Wordle. The game allows players to guess a **seven-letter word**, providing feedback based on the correctness of their guesses.

## Installation
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Run `app.py` to start the game.
- Players enter a seven-letter word as a guess.
- The game provides feedback:
  - **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position.
  - **Yellow**: Correct letter in the wrong position.
  - **Gray**: Letter is not in the word.

## Customization
You can modify the game settings to fit your preferences:

### Changing the Word Length
If you want to use a different word length instead of seven letters:
1. Replace the words in `common-7-letter-words.txt` with words of your desired length.
2. Ensure that all words in the file match the intended length to maintain consistency in gameplay.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
To change the number of allowed guesses:
1. Open `app.py` (or the relevant settings file).
2. Locate the `MAX_GUESSES` variable.
3. Modify its value to increase or decrease the number of allowed guesses:
   ```python
   MAX_GUESSES = 10  # Increase to allow more attempts
   ```
   A lower value makes the game harder, while a higher value makes it easier.

## Features
- Wordlist from `common-7-letter-words.txt`
- Interactive user interface (CSS-based design)
- Adjustable difficulty (via `MAX_GUESSES`)
- Flexible word length customization
